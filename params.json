{"name":"Pysa","tagline":"Pysa - Reverse your servers configuration!","body":"### Welcome to Pysa project page.\r\n\r\nPysa is a configuration reverse engineering software, which is aimed to help anyone who wants to replicate an existing computer configuration - and not simply clone the entire machine.\r\nIt can be used to migrate configurations from one computer to another (including physical machines to virtual Clouds), backup existing configurations, or for any other migration purpose.\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\nPysa has been designed for UNIX Operating Systems. However, only Linux based distributions are supported for now (tested on Ubuntu, Debian, Cent OS, RedHat and Amazon Linux latest and LTS versions).\r\nMore will come later.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to install Pysa: using the sources files or using the PyPI packages repository.\r\n\r\n#### Using PyPI (recommended)\r\n\r\n- Ensure [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html) is setup on your computer (you can alternatively use other PyPI managers, like easy_install)\r\n- Setup Pysa in its latest version `pip install pysa`\r\n- Run Pysa (see [documentation](http://madeira-cloud-pysa-document.readthedocs.org/en/latest/))\r\n\r\n#### Sources setup\r\n\r\n- Clone this git repo `git clone https://github.com/MadeiraCloud/pysa.git`\r\n- Run Pysa (pysa.py - see [documentation](http://madeira-cloud-pysa-document.readthedocs.org/en/latest/))\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nYou can access the documentation at http://madeira-cloud-pysa-document.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n- Thibault BRONCHAIN @tbronchain\r\n- Michael CHO @newthinker\r\n- Ken CHEN @guojian\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble, remarks or suggestions about Pysa?
